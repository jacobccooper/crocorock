Data for the Crocorock Tutorial at the University of Chicago. All data was created by Jacob C. Cooper and his collaborators.

*Cinnyris* sunbird information was obtained by Jacob C. Cooper, Dylan Maddox, Kellie McKague, and John M. Bates from the collections at the Field Museum of Natural History. This data, in whole and in part, will soon be submitted for publication. These data have been made available only for use in this tutorial, and large amounts of outgroup and ingroup information have been removed to prevent people from stealing our research. I will update this `readme` after publication, but if there are any present questions about these data please contact me.

Woodpecker data are adapted directly from:

[Cooper, Jacob C. 2018. "Niche theory and its relation to morphology and phenotype in geographic space: a case study in woodpecker (Picidae). *Journal of Avian Biology* e01771.](doi:10.1111/jav.01771)

Please see that publication for data sources and a link to a dryad repository with the complete code. If you wish to use any of these woodpecker data or code derived from the woodpecker example in this tutorial, please cite Cooper (2018).

These data are designed to be run in an `Ubuntu` environment with a `maui` and `PBS` job scheduler installed. These examples provide a workthrough for analyzing data and submitting jobs on the **Crocorock** at the University of Chicago.

This machine is owned and operated by the [Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago](https://evbio.uchicago.edu/).
